- Data loading from external CSV files
- Statistics about the Airports, Airlines, Flights and Cities/Countries
- Statistics about the graph (articulation points, diameter, longest route)
- Search for best route based on Aiport Code/Name, Country/City or Coordinates
- Filters for the previous search in terms of Airport, City and Country Restrictions
